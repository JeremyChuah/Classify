# Classify

## About Classify
Classify allows students to view the difficulty, experience, etc. of a class and give their own ratings about it too. All of these ratings are then averaged and comments can be viewed by any student. It also helps students see what their day would look like given their course load. It does so by allowing you to fill out your schedule and our application will average out all of the statistics from all your classes. 

## How it was built
We used React, AWS, and Google Domains to build this application. We used React for the frontend and AWS Amplify for the backed and domain hosting. We also used Google Domains to set up our SSL server and host our application on our website. We used AWS Amplify becuase of its beginner friendly and streamnlined fetaures such as its simple integration of AWS cognito and DynamoDB. React was also used because of its easy integration with AWS Amplify as well as TailwindCSS.

<br>**Unfortunately we have taken the website domain and servers down due to maintenence costs**<br>
<br>
However, when it was running, developers could start up the applications using standard react ``npm start``.
